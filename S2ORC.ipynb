       "['The formalism of Quantum Mechanics (QM) is based on conserving probabilities. In principle, therefore, there is no room for the description of time-irreversible evolution (the arrow of time) in QM. One has to introduce some sort of generalized quantum formalism in order to describe dissipative systems. The developments of the theory of unstable states going beyond the Breit-Wigner treatment and other phenomenological approaches have been frequently reported in the literature. See for example refs. [1] - [5] .',\n",

I show [17] that the proper algebraic structure of QFT is the deformed Hopf algebra [18, 19] and that the doubling of the phase-space degrees of freedom implied by such a structure is related to quantum noise effects in the case of dissipative systems [15] .',\n",
       " 'The microscopic theory for a dissipative system must include the details of the processes responsible for dissipation, including quantum effects. One may start since the beginning with a Hamiltonian that describes the system, the bath and the system-bath interaction. Subsequently, the description of the original dissipative system is recovered by the reduced density matrix obtained by eliminating the bath variables which originate the damping and the fluctuations. The problem with dissipative systems in QM is indeed that ccr are not preserved by time evolution due to damping terms. The rôle of fluctuating forces is in fact the one of preserving the canonical structure.',\n",
       " 'It is known since long time [20] that, at a classical level, the attempt to derive from a variational principle the equations of motion defining the dissipative system requires the introduction of additional complementary equations.',\n",

[21] and [12] - [16] the quantization of the damped harmonic oscillator (dho) has been studied by doubling the phase-space degrees of freedom (see also [22] for the study of unstable particle in QFT). The doubled degrees of freedom play the rôle of the bath degrees of freedom. Let me observe that the canonical formalism is devised solely for closed systems, therefore in order to produce the canonical quantization of the damped oscillator, it is necessary and sufficient to close the system, namely to \"balance\" the energy flux, the momentum exchange, etc.. For that task, and only for that task, we do not really need to know the details of the environment and not even the details of the system-environment coupling: therefore, for such a limited task, we may \"simulate\" the environment as a collection of oscillators whose k-modes match the k-modes of our damped oscillator. With such a choice the environment, depicted as the system time-reversed double, is treated as the \"effective\" environment. Of course, in those cases in which such a crude simplification is not enough (we might be really interested in the details of the system-environment interface, for example) much more care is needed and the doubling picture is not enough. In Sec. 2 I present the approach based on the system doubling.',\n",

It is a real problem the one of the description of open systems in a mathematically consistent formalism in QFT. QFT is in fact the only available theoretical scheme to describe high energy physics, as well as condensed matter physics, and quantum systems are always open systems interacting with their environment. It is true that in many cases the approximation of treating them as closed systems is very useful and successful for phenomenological computations, nevertheless there are many cases in which dissipative effects and breakdown of time reversal symmetry cannot be neglected. In these latter circumstances we do need a reliable, mathematically consistent QFT formalism.',\n",

Moreover, it has been applied [31, 32, 33] to the study of the memory capacity problem in the quantum model for the brain [34] .',\n",

To cure these pathologies one must move to QFT, where infinitely many unitarily inequivalent representations of the ccr are allowed (in the infinite volume or thermodynamic limit). The reason for this is that the set of the states of the damped oscillator splits into ui representations (i.e. into disjoint folia, in the C*-algebra formalism) each one representing the states of the system at time t: the time irreversible evolution is described as tunneling between ui representations. A remarkable feature of this description thus emerges: at microscopic level the irreversibility of time evolution (the arrow of time) is expressed by the non unitary evolution across the ui representations of the ccr.',\n",

I then show [17] that dissipative systems are properly described in the frame of the q-deformed Hopf algebra [18, 19, 39] . The q-deformation parameter turns out to be related with time parameter in the case of dho and with temperature in the case of thermal field theory. In both cases, the q-parameter acts as a label for the ui representations. Such a conclusion confirms a general analysis [40] which shows that the Weyl representations in QM and the ui representations in QFT are indeed labeled by the deformation parameter.',\n",

H + Q is therefore to be identified with the free energy [14, 22] . In this way the results of Sec. 3 are also recovered. Thus, the conclusion is that variations in time of the deformation parameter actually involve dissipation. When the proper field description is taken into account, A and B carry dependence on the momentum κ and, as customary in QFT, one deals with the algebras κ h κ (1) (cf. Sec. 2).',\n",
       " 'The dho total Hamiltonian is invariant under the transformations generated by',\n",
       " 'The vacuum however is not invariant under J 2 (see eq. (19)) in the infinite volume limit. Moreover, at each time t, the representation {|0(t) >} may be characterized by the expectation value in the state |0(t) > of, e.g., J (κ) 3 − 1 2 : thus the total number of particles n A + n B = 2n can be taken as an order parameter. Therefore, at each time t the symmetry under J 2 transformations is spontaneously broken. On the other hand, H I is proportional to J 2 . Thus, in addition to the breakdown of time-reversal (discrete) symmetry, already mentioned in Secion 2, we also have spontaneous breakdown of time translation (continuous) symmetry. In other words, dissipation (i.e. energy non-conservation), has been described as an effect of the breakdown of time translation and time-reversal symmetry. It is an interesting question asking which is the zero-frequency mode, playing the rôle of the Goldstone mode, related with the breakdown of continuous time translation symmetry: I observe that since n A − n B is constant in time, the condensation (annihilation and/or creation) of AB-pairs does not contribute to the vacuum energy so that AB-pair may play the rôle of a zero-frequency mode.',\n",
       " 'In the discussion presented above a crucial rôle is played by the existence of infinitely many ui representations of the ccr in QFT. In refs. [24, 40] the q-WH algebra has been discussed in relation with the von Neumann theorem in QM and it has been shown on a general ground that the q-deformation parameter acts as a label for the Weyl systems in QM and for the ui representations in QFT; the mapping between different (i.e. labeled by different values of q) representations (or Weyl systems) being performed by the Bogolubov transformations. Damped harmonic oscillator and finite temperature systems are explicit examples clarifying the physical meaning of such a labeling. Further examples are provided by unstable particles in QFT [22] , by quantization of the matter field in curved space-time [30] , by theories with spontaneous breakdown of symmetry where different values of the order parameter are associated to different ui representations (different phases). In the case of damping, as well as in the case of time-dependent temperature, the system time-evolution is represented as tunneling through ui representations: the non-unitary character of time-evolution (arrow of time) is thus expressed by the non-unitary equivalence of the representations in the infinite volume limit. It is remarkable that at the algebraic level this is made possible through the q-deformation mechanism which organizes the representations in an ordered set by means of the labeling.',\n",
       " 'In conclusion, from the point of view of boson condensation, time evolution in the presence of damping may be thus thought of as a sort of continuous transition among different phases, each phase corresponding, at time t, to the coherent state representation {|0(t) >}. The damped oscillator thus provides an archetype of system undergoing continuous phase transition.',\n",
       " \"As already mentioned in the introduction, dissipation in classical deterministic systems (such as the couple of classical oscillators described by eqs. (1) and (3) in Sec. 2) has been shown [29] to lead under suitable conditions to a quantum behavior, as originally proposed by 't Hooft [28] . In particular, dissipation manifests as a geometric Berry-Anandan-like phase [23] and it appears to be responsible for the zero point energy contribution in the oscillator energy spectrum [29] .\",\n",
       " 'The features of the dissipative quantum dynamics discussed in this paper have been also used [31, 32, 33] to implement an infinite memory capacity in the quantum model of brain [34] . The key point is in the fact that dissipative dynamics implies infinitely many degenerate vacua (i.e. the zero eigenvalue eigenstates of H 0 , eqs. (9) and (18)), each of them describing a possible memory state according to the brain model of ref. [34] . Moreover, in view of the thermal character of such vacua illustrated in Sec. 3, the irreversible time evolution of the brain memory states, which is perceived as the arrow of time at a psychological experience level, appears to proceed in the same direction of the thermodynamical and of the cosmological arrow of time mentioned in Sec. 3. It is interesting to note that in a somewhat unexpected way it emerges a possible answer to the questions raised by the ongoing debate [45] on the coincidence (or not) of the directions of the three arrows of times just mentioned. Finally, the dissipative quantum model of brain has revealed to be also interesting in the study of features related with consciousness mechanisms [33] .',\n",

       " 'The quark model of hadrons has proved to be successful in describing hadrons and their properties. In the heavy quark sector it predicts hadrons having c, b and t quarks as constituents. However, the discovery of the top quark [1] and the determination of its lifetime [2] made it clear that it cannot participate in strong interactions and therefore only the c and b flavors are left to take part in the hadron production interplay.',\n",
       " 'Baryon states with heavy flavor fall into three categories. States containing one heavy flavor such as Λ c and Λ b are interesting states due to the fact that they carry the original heavy flavor polarization. They are presently being studied experimentally [5] . The second category involves baryons with two heavy flavor like the states Ξ cc , Ξ bb and Ξ bc [6] . They are treated within the approximate quark-diquark model [7] . The model treats the production of the so called diquark perturbatively similar to the states such as B c . Then, it can be proved that the formation of a baryon out of the diquark is almost the same as the fragmentation of an antiquark into a meson. In this way one obtains the fragmentation functions, the total production probabilities and other relevant parameters which specify their properties. In the third category, we have baryons with three heavy constituents. If we follow the scheme used in the case of heavy mesons and assume that their fragmentation functions are calculable in the perturbative regime, then we can calculate Feynman diagrams like the one in figure 1 to obtain the fragmentation functions. There are eight such diagrams in the lowest order contributing triply heavy baryons, i.e. Ω ccc , Ω ccb , Ω cbb and Ω bbb production [8] .',\n",

       " 'We consider the fragmentation of a heavy quark Q into a QQQ system with three identical flavor. This procedure is illustrated in Figure 1 . We have used an infinite momentum frame in which all of the particles are moved in the forward direction, i.e. the longitudinal direction along the z axes, where the QQQ moves. We let the original quark keep its transverse momentum. Furthermore, we assume that the two antiquark jets move almost in the same direction. This assumption is justified due to the fact that the very high momentum of the initial heavy quark will predominantly be carried in the forward direction. Due to momentum conservation, the total transverse momentum of the two jets will be identical to the transverse momentum of the initial quark. In this context the four momenta of the particles will assume the following form',\n",

The average over initial spin states and the sum over final spin states are performed. The heavy hadron production amplitude is composed of a partonic part, which can be calculated using perturbative QCD, and a non-perturbative part, which describes the transition of free quarks into the final state hadron. In the framework of non-relativistic quark model, this non-perturbative part could be accounted for through the wave function which is calculable using potential models. Since at present there is no known information concerning such wave functions, we have assumed a delta function type wave function for them. This assumption guarantees that the constituents will fly parallel and have no transverse momentum with respect to their direction of motion. This is also consistent with our assumptions in section 2. The hard scattering amplitude which is obtained by perturbative calculations of the tree diagram in figure 1 , may be put in the following form [9] ,',\n",
